After careful consideration and meticulous observations of all of our group
member’s assignment source code, we have found the most appropriate code to use.
Our group will exclusively use Jayden Arquelada’s code for 3 very important reasons.
The first reason being that Jayden Arquelada was the only person in our group
who had finished bank.java (CandyCane). Thus jayden’s code has already tested a few features
and implementations. The second reason is that our group <3<3 loves the design
choices made by Jayden. The program handled exceptions well, rather than
throwing them, functioning close to how real world bank machines work. Also, it
let the user know whether things were successfully added, updated, or selected
from the database through returns or print statements.

Finally, Jayden has superb comments that are all specific and easy to follow so
it would be really easy for everyone to be up to pace when we start the assignment.
Due to these reasons, our grouped has come to a general concesus that we should
use Jayden's code.

brink of destruction.
